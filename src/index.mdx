# Introduction
`live-stream-radio` is a 24/7 live stream radiostation CLI built with Node.js and powered by FFmpeg. This means that you'll be able to start a livestream radio for music, a looping gif/video, music information and other overlay items. This project is highly customizable and also features a REST HTTP JSON API for frontend interfaces.

To get a first glimpse on how to use this project, head over to the [Getting Started](/cli/getting-started) page!

## Compatibility
We try to make this project compatible with any OS that supports both NodeJS and FFmpeg. As this projects roots are in the raspberry-pi community (funfact: this projects was named piStreamRadio before 2.0.0), we specifically try to support the Raspbian plattform.
