# Installation

1. Install the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm). The reccomended way of doing this is with `nvm`. (Mac and Linux: [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), Windows: [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)). Then run the following in your command line:


```shell
nvm install --lts
```

2. Download/Compile the latest version of [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org). However, the FFmpeg build must be compiled with [libfreetype to support the `drawtext` filter](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#drawtext). For example, on macOS with brew you can do: `brew install ffmpeg --with-freetype`. For other Operating Systems, you may find luck using [hosted static builds](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/), or refer to the [FFmpeg Compilation Guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide). For Raspbian / Raspberry Pi users, feel free to use the [Raspbian Stretch FFmpeg binary](https://github.com/torch2424/piStreamRadio/tree/0b75cae32cadb21d8af07584f0cfc4b9a287c077/ffmpeg) that was previously in the repo from version `1.0.0`.

3. Globally install the `live-stream-radio` module:

```shell
npm install -g live-stream-radio
```

```shell
live-stream-radio --help

5. Generate a stream project üõ†Ô∏è:

```shell
live-stream-radio --generate myStream/
```

Please see the "Project Management" section in the documentation for the meaning of the `config.json` keys. **Quick Note:** The `$stream_key` is replaced in the `stream_url` value, with the value of the `stream_key`.

```shell
live-stream-radio --start myStream/
```
