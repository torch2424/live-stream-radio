# Config

This documents the fields of a project `config.json`. This will use an invalid comments in json in order to show what each field means. Please see the [default project generator config.json](https://github.com/torch2424/live-stream-radio/blob/master/src/generate/template/config.json) if you ever need to reset your config to the default settings.
