# Config

This page will go in detail with every field of a projects `config.json`. If you ever need to reset the default settings, or see an example `config.json`, please check out the [default config.json](https://github.com/torch2424/live-stream-radio/blob/master/src/generate/template/config.json).

## Settings Fields

| Field | Usage |
| - | - |
| stream_url | The URL of the stream. You can use $stream_key as a variable, this will replace it with the value of stream_key. You can overwrite this field with the `--output` CLI flag. |
| stream_key | The stream key provided by your stream platform. |

| radio.overlay.song | Common Text Object for the song. |
| radio.overlay.image | Common Image Object for an overlay over the text and video. |
| interlude.enabled | Enables interludes which are are transition videos/audios played in-between songs. |
| interlude.frequency | Percentage of how often an interlude should be played. Valid values are from 0.0 (never) to 1.0 (100% of the time). |
| interlude.audio_directory | Path to your interlude music. Check out the FAQ for supported file types. |
| interlude.video_directory | Path to your interlude videos and gifs. Check out the FAQ for supported file types. |
| interlude.overlay.enabled | Enables overlays in interludes. |
| interlude.overlay.font_path | Path to the fonts used for the stream overlays. Check out the FAQ for supported file types. |
| interlude.overlay.title | Common Text Object for the a title. |
| interlude.overlay.image | Common Image Object for an overlay over the text and video. |

### Video HeightWidth Ratio

```
"some-text-object": {
  "enabled": true
  "text": "Live Stream Radio, 24/7 Open Source Radio",
  "font_color": "#FFFFFF",
  "font_border": "#000000",
  "font_size": "10",

## Dynamic Config

It is possible to add extra functionality to how `live-stream-radio` parses your config.json per song. For example, if you would like to build:

* A radio station that plays certain songs during a certain time of day
* Shows a different title depending on the last song played
* Uses an API to decide what song to play

This can be done by adding a `config.js` to the root of your project. In other words, in the same root of the project that your `config.json` resides. This `config.js` simply exports a single [async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) function, or function that returns a promise, that resolves an object representing a `config.json`. This function takes in a projectPath, and a streamState Object and can use those before deciding any final decisions. **Note:** `config.js` will take precendence over any `config.json`, and it is reccomended that you use your config.json as a fallback and resolved by your `config.js` exported async function.

### Function Definition

**Params**

* path (string) - Absolute path of the current project directory

* streamState (Object) - Object containing various information about the stream

| streamState Field | Usage |
| - | - |
| history | History of the activites performed on the stream, recorded in the history service. See [/live-stream-radio/api/endpoints#get-history] |

### Example

So let's take the first example, **A radio station that plays certain songs during a certain time of day**. What we can do is make seperate folders in our project for each hour on a 24 hour time, and use [getHours()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getHours) to get the current hour of the day.

**config.js**

```js
module.exports = async (path, streamState) => {
  let config = require(`${path}config.json`);

  const date = new Date();
  const currentHour = date.getHours();
  config.radio.audio_directory = `./my/audio/directory/${currentHour}`;

  return config;
}
```
