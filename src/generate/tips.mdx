# Tips

## File Management

I'd suggest using a lightweight file server like [Droppy](https://github.com/silverwind/droppy) to allow easy access to your stream files. Also, Droppy will let you edit the `config.json` file on the server itself! Another file server I could suggest would be [Filerun](http://www.filerun.com/), it is a lot heavier than Droppy, but offers a more robust interface, and file meta data editing!

## Systemd / Run on Boot

On Ubuntu and Raspbian machine, you can get the stream to run on boot using systemd. I have a [systemctl service](https://github.com/torch2424/dotFiles/blob/master/.files_templates/systemctl.service) in my personal dotfiles I fill out to do this. I'd suggest looking there, and the links I provided in the comments to see how to get up and running with this. Another alternative is to look into setting this up in a crontab using `@reboot`.
