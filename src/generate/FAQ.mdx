# FAQ

## What are the Supported File Types

| Type | Supported Filetypes |
| - | - |
| Audio | `.mp3` |
| Video | `.mp4` `.webm` `.gif` |
| Font | `.ttf` |

Using .gifs is not recommended, as both file-size and performance are better for video files.


## How is Audio Metadata determined

Audio metadata is collected using [music-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/music-metadata). I'd suggest ensuring that all of your audio has the correct metadata before uploading it to your project.

## Can I Edit the Project While it is Running

*In Theory*, yes. You should be able to add files while the stream is running, and have them added to be streamed at a later point. However, be cautious of deleting files, as they may be streaming at the time of deletion and cause a crash. 

The `config.json` currently requires a reboot of the stream to apply any changes.
