# FAQ

## What are the Supported File Types

| Type | Supported Filetypes |
| - | - |
| Audio | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac` |
| Video | `.mp4`, `.gif`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.webm` |
| Font | `.ttf` |

In terms of encoding video, `.gif` files are the slowest as they need to be pre-encoded before encoded onto the stream.


## How is Audio Metadata determined

Audio metadata is collected using [music-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/music-metadata). I'd suggest ensuring that all of your audio has the correct metadata before uploading it to your project.

## Can I Edit the Project While it is Running

*In Theory*, yes. You should be able to add files while the stream is running, and have them added to be streamed at a later point. However, be cautious of deleting files, as they may be streaming at the time of deletion and cause a crash. 

The `config.json` currently requires a reboot of the stream to apply any changes.
