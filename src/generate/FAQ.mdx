# FAQ

## What are the Supported File Types

| Type | Supported Filetypes |
| - | - |
| Audio | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac` |
| Video | `.mp4`, `.gif`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.webm` |
| Font | `.ttf` |
| Image | `.png` |

In terms of encoding video, `.gif` files are the slowest as they need to be pre-encoded before encoded onto the stream.

## What are some reccomended technical stream settings

Here is the [Youtube Reccomended Livestream](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702?hl=en) configuration for streaming software, as well as the [Twitch Reccomended Settings](https://stream.twitch.tv/).

## How is Audio Metadata determined

Audio metadata is collected using [music-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/music-metadata). I'd suggest ensuring that all of your audio has the correct metadata before uploading it to your project.

## How are the overlays layered

The overlays are layered over one another in the following order:

* Video (bottom)
* Image
* Text (top)

Also, as a comparison to CSS z-index, The video could be 0, the image could be 1, and the text could be 2. 

Also, this means that if we enabled the image overlay, it should contain transparency to see the video underneath.

## Can I Edit the Project While it is Running

*In Theory*, yes. You should be able to add files while the stream is running, and have them added to be streamed at a later point. However, be cautious of deleting files, as they may be streaming at the time of deletion and cause a crash. 

Also, be cautious editing the `config.json`, as having a bad config will exit the process.
