# FAQ

## What are the Supported File Types

### Audio

`.mp3`

### Video

`.mp4`, `.webm`, `.gif`

However, I reccomend avoiding gifs, as you can get much better quality out of other formats, and will run much more performant.

### Font

`.ttf`

## How is Audio Metadata determined

Audio metadata is collected using [music-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/music-metadata). I'd suggest ensuring that all of your audio has the correct metadata before uploading it to your project.

## Can I Edit the Project While it is Running

*In Theory*, yes. You should be able to add files while the stream is running, and have them added to be streamed at a later point. However, be cautious of deleting files, as they may be streaming at the time of deletion and cause a crash. 

The `config.json` currently requires a reboot of the stream to apply any changes.
