# Raspberry Pi

This page contains tips for setting up `live-stream-radio` on a raspberry pi. If you have any performance issues, or are not comfortable using Node.js, feel free to use the older (no longer updated) version of the project, [piStreamRadio v1.2.0](https://github.com/torch2424/live-stream-radio/tree/1.2.0). Please read over the [CLI Getting Started](/cli/getting-started) to have context on what steps are required, and how these steps streamline the usual install process for Raspberry Pis.

### FFmpeg Installation

Installing live-stream-radio on a raspberry pi follows the same proedures from the [CLI Getting Started](/cli/getting-started), however, there is a more streamlined way of getting FFmpeg installed. Since the project was formerly called `piStreamRadio`, we have an old script to compile FFmpeg for you on the [piStreamRadio v1.2.0 `additionalScripts/compileFFmpeg.sh`](https://github.com/torch2424/live-stream-radio/blob/1.2.0/additionalScripts/compileFFmpeg.sh). Re-iterating from the [CLI Getting Started](/cli/getting-started), **Note: this project requires FFmpeg version 4.2.0 or greater in order to ensure the best performance. [Please see this issue for explanation](https://github.com/torch2424/live-stream-radio/issues/78)**.

### Configuring your project

After following the easy FFmpeg installation steps above, and completing the rest of the [CLI Getting Started](/cli/getting-started), here are some nice defaults for raspberry pi to get things performing better. You want to replace the values of the keys in your project `congig.json` with the ones below:

| Field | Usage |
| - | - |
| audio_codec | "libfdk_aac" |
| crf | "32" |
| preset | "ultrafast" |

This should definitely help performance and reduce buffering for your viewers. Also, note, that decreasing "video_fps" may not actuall improve your performance, as this can affect how videos are encoded, and the rate at which this happens.

### Adding Video to your project

We **Definitely** reccomend using the fastest formats for decoding so that they can be encoded faster and put less strain on the pi. We reccomend adding `.webm` to store your video, as for some reason FFmpeg tends to handle this to best.
