`live-stream-radio` is a 24/7 live stream video radio station 📹 📻 CLI built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and powered by [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org).

# Example Assets from the `--generate` template

Music is by [Aviscerall](https://aviscerall.bandcamp.com/), and [Marquice Turner](https://marquiceturner.bandcamp.com/). Which is actually me (@torch2424), but I have a musical identitiy problem 😛 . The .mp4 and .webm of the rotating earth, is a [public domain video I found on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuY1RXZyUFs). The image overlay uses images from EmojiOne, in particular, their [video camera emoji](https://www.emojione.com/emoji/1f4f9), and their [radio emoji](https://www.emojione.com/emoji/1f4fb).
