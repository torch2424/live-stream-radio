# Folders for the files for the radio

Don't place folders within these folders, and ensure the files are of the correct format for each folder

`music` is where ".mp3" is stored to be played as songs on the station
`gifs` is where ".gif" files are stored to be encoded
`fonts` is where fonts can be placed and referenced from the config.sh
`interludes` is where ".mp3" is stored, to be played randomly between songs to add any radio themed ambiance.

Demo music is provided by [Aviscerall](https://aviscerall.bandcamp.com/), demo .gifs come from my previous projects, and [Code and Coffee LB](http://www.codeandcoffeelb.org/), demo interlude sounds come from [soundbible](http://soundbible.com/tags-radio.html).
